Funtoo-ProAudio-Overlay
========================
This overlay is a fork (really an import from an svn repository) of the proaudio overlay for gentoo, intended for use on funtoo.

Why are you doing this?
------------------------
Unfortunately, many of the packages listed by this repository are outdated. I will do my best to connect them to the most recent versions.

Similarly, I am a textbook audiophile.

Lastly, I enjoy doing this kind of thing. Plus, I love Funtoo.

Currently, this is not quite ready for use. I will post instructions when I am relatively confident it could be useful to people, but, again, it is not yet at that state.
