Funtoo-ProAudio-Overlay
========================
This overlay is a fork (really an import from an svn repository) of the proaudio overlay for gentoo, intended for use on funtoo. If you are one of the people who worked on this project origionally, please provide your email and I'll be sure to connect your GitHub account to this project.

Why are you doing this?
------------------------
Unfortunately, many of the packages listed by this repository are outdated. I will do my best to connect them to the most recent versions.

Similarly, I am a textbook audiophile.

Lastly, I enjoy doing this kind of thing. Plus, I love Funtoo.


Status
=======
Well, it's working for me. I do not have everything installed, however! If something doesn't build, please file a bug report and I'll try to get it working. If you know how to fix it, feel free to. If something is outdated, you should also file a bug report.

Installation
=============
Thanks to Layman, this is rather simple. Just run the following command:

<code> # layman -f -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allenh1/funtoo-proaudio-overlay/master/overlay.xml -a funtoo-proaudio </code>
